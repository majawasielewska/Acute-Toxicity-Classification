# Acute-Toxicity-Classification

The dataset used in project was extracted from a large collection of research studies conducted in 2021 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014765132031575X).

The file "Dataset-Daphniamagna.xlsx" contains the extracted dataset on which I based the analysis.

The file "Statistical-Analysis-Dataset.ipynb" presents a statistical analysis of a dataset.

This project was to create five machine learning models based on five supervised ML algorithms, such as: kNN, SVM, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, MLP in the problem of classifying 495 chemical compounds into 'Highly toxic' and 'Low toxic to non-toxic' compounds. These results are in the file "Implementation-ML-Algorithms".
